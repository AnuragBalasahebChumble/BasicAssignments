Answer --> True & False

## Q2 What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

AND, OR, NOT

##Q3 Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

True and True is True.

True and False is False.

False and True is False.

False and False is False.

True or True is True.

True or False is True.

False or True is True.

False or False is False.

not True is False.

not False is True.

##Q4 What are the values of the following expressions?
i. (5 &gt; 4) and (3 == 5), 
ii. not (5 &gt; 4), 
iii. (5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5), 
iv. not ((5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5)), 
v. (True and True) and (True == False), 
vi. (not False) or (not True)

i)False
ii)False
iii)True
iv)False
v)False
vi)True

Q5 What are the six comparison operators?

Ans ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=
"

##Q6 Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
"""

"""
equal to is actually a comparision operator, represented by '==' & assignment is represented by '='
When we want assign value to a variable we'll use '='
When we want to compare two entities we'll use '=='

"""##Q9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

Ans. If program is stuck in endless loop we will press ctrl+c.

##Q10 How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
"""

"""
break --> break key word breaks the current loop

continue --> continue keyword is usally use to not to take any action if certain criteria is satisfied.

"""
All three of them wll give same output.
i. range(10) will start loop from 0 continue till 9
ii. range(0,10) will start loop from 0 continue till 9
iii. range(0,10,1) will start loop from 0 continue till 9 & stepsize will be 1.
