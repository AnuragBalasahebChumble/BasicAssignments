1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?

==> Functions allow us to use the same code again & again. Reusability is made possible.

2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it is called?

==> When it is called.

3. What statement creates a function?

==> def key word creates a function. example "def functionName(argumets if any)"


4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?

==> function is a piece of code which get's executed when function is called within a program. 


5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?

==> There is One global scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates. 
 Local scope is created whenever a function is called.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?

==> When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed.


7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?


==> A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.


8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?

==>  If the funtion does not have a return statement it will not return anything.

9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?

==> To make function variable as a global variable you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.


10. What is the data type of None?

==> NoneType


11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?

==> It will the module caled 'areallyourpetsnamederic'

12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?

==> spam.bacon() 

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?

==> We can use try except clause to save a program from crashing.

14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?

==> Try block will allow the execution of code but in secured environment.
except block comes after try block to handle errors if genrated in the try block.
Both together acts as a crash proof mechanism.
