        "- In Python, variables are used to store data values. Here are the rules for creating variables in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Variable Names: Variable names in Python can consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), - digits (0-9), and underscores (_). However, the variable name cannot start with a digit.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Case-Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, so variable names like \"myVar\" and \"myvar\" are considered different.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Reserved Keywords: You cannot use reserved keywords as variable names since they have predefined meanings in Python. For example, \"if,\" \"for,\" \"while,\" and \"print\" are reserved keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Valid Examples: Valid variable names can include combinations of letters, digits, and underscores. Some examples of valid variable names are \"my_var,\" \"number1,\" and \"total_sum.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- Descriptive Names: It is good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names for variables. This helps in understanding the purpose or content of the variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Avoiding Built-in Names: It's generally recommended to avoid using names that conflict with built-in functions or modules. For example, avoid naming a variable \"list\" as it would conflict with the built-in list type.\n"

        "Q.3. What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in python to improve code readability and maintainability?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python, there are widely accepted standards and conventions for naming variables that help improve code readability and maintainability. The most commonly followed conventions are outlined below:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use descriptive names: Variable names should be descriptive and convey the purpose or content of the variable. This helps other programmers (including your future self) understand the code better. For example, instead of using a generic name like x, use a more descriptive name like num_students or average_score.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use lowercase with underscores: Python conventionally uses lowercase letters with underscores to separate words in variable names. This is known as \"snake_case\". For example, total_score, student_name, and is_valid are all valid snake_case variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Avoid using single characters: While it is technically allowed to use single-character variable names, it's generally recommended to avoid them unless they have a well-established meaning in the domain. Using descriptive names helps make the code more self-explanatory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Be consistent and meaningful: Maintain consistency in your naming conventions throughout your codebase. Choose meaningful and related names for variables to maintain clarity. For example, if you have variables related to a customer, use names like customer_id, customer_name, and customer_address rather than mixing different terms like cust_id, cname, and cust_add.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Follow PEP 8 guidelines: PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code. It provides recommendations on various aspects of code style, including variable naming. It suggests using lowercase letters with underscores for variable names, except for some specific cases like constants or class names. Adhering to PEP 8 guidelines helps make your code more consistent and readable for other Python developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Avoid using reserved keywords: Ensure that your variable names do not conflict with Python's reserved keywords. Using reserved keywords as variable names can lead to syntax errors. For example, avoid naming a variable print or for.\n",
        "\n",
        "- By following these standards and conventions, you can write code that is more readable, maintainable, and consistent. It also helps improve collaboration with other programmers and makes your code easier to understand and debug."
